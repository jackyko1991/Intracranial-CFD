# Intracranial-CFD

A simple tool to perform vessel segmentation based on 3DRA and post contrast CBCT data.

## Usage

## Workflow
1. Batch conversion of DICOM to NIFTI format
2. Image registration (recommend to use 3D slicer if manual initialization is needed)
3. Vessel segmentation with mutiple Otsu thresholding
4. Perform surface comparison
